# About The Project

The promise of zk-Rizz, the web3 dating platform that uses zero knowledge proofs to verify identity and match users. Unlike other dating apps that rely on superficial swipes and filters, zk-Rizz curates profiles based on shared interests and compatibility, so you can connect with someone who truly understands you. And you donâ€™t have to worry about your privacy, because zk-Rizz never reveals your personal information or preferences to anyone. zk-Rizz is more than just a dating app, itâ€™s a movement to change the way we date online. Join us today and discover the power of zero knowledge, infinite love.

DPI UX is implemented as a web app which can be used to send and receive payments across chains.As a payments interface it is non-custodial and the user is in full control of their assets.Transfers are the key feature of the app and it is powered by Connext to enable cross chain transfers.Push protocol is used to enable reliable transaction notification.Contracts are deployed on every EVM based chains and the user can deploy smart wallets on any of the supported chains.
The user can :

1. Create a smart wallet at deterministic address.
2. Fund the smart wallet with any supported token.
3. Send and receive payments across chains via ENS or public addresses.
4. Use QR code to send and receive payments.
